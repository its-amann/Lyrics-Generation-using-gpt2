## 4. Mathematics Behind GPT-2 üìöü§ñ

GPT-2 is a Transformer-based model designed for language generation. At its core, it relies on the following mathematical principles and mechanisms:

### 1. Transformer Architecture
The GPT-2 model is built on the Transformer architecture, which uses **self-attention** and **positional encoding** to process text efficiently.

#### Key Components:
- **Input Embedding (\( X_e \)):**
  - Each word in the input sequence is converted into a dense vector representation.
  - Example:
    - Input: _"Hello, world!"_
    - Token Embedding: \([e_{hello}, e_{,}, e_{world}, e_{!}]\)

- **Positional Encoding (\( P \)):**
  - Adds information about word order to the embeddings.
  - Final Input: \( X = X_e + P \)

- **Self-Attention Mechanism:**
  - Computes relationships between all tokens in the sequence:
    \[
    \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
    \]
    - \( Q \), \( K \), and \( V \): Query, Key, and Value matrices derived from \( X \).
    - \( d_k \): Dimension of the key vectors.

- **Feedforward Neural Networks:**
  - Applies dense layers to transform attention outputs:
    \[
    FFN(X) = \text{ReLU}(XW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
    \]

### 2. Autoregressive Modeling
GPT-2 predicts the next word in a sequence using its **autoregressive property**:
\[
P(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(w_i \mid w_1, w_2, \dots, w_{i-1})
\]

For example:
- Input: _"Walking through the"_
- Predicted next word: _"forest"_.

### 3. Training Objective
GPT-2 is trained using a **causal language modeling (CLM)** objective:
\[
\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{i=1}^N \log P(w_i \mid w_1, w_2, \dots, w_{i-1})
\]
Where:
- \( w_i \): Current word.
- \( w_1, w_2, \dots, w_{i-1} \): Context of previous words.

### 4. Fine-Tuning for Lyrics
Fine-tuning adjusts GPT-2‚Äôs weights on a lyrics dataset:
- Training Objective remains the same, but focuses on the patterns in lyrical data (e.g., rhymes, repetitions).

### Example:
1. **Input:** _"Under the moonlight, so bright"_
2. **GPT-2 Attention Mechanism:**
   - Encodes the relationship between words (e.g., "moonlight" and "bright").
3. **Output:** _"I dance till the morning light."_

By combining these mathematical concepts, GPT-2 generates coherent, context-aware, and creative lyrics.

## 5. Example Data Flow üöÄüìÑ

This section demonstrates how a sample prompt flows through the lyrics generation pipeline using GPT-2, breaking down each step with details.

---

### Step 1: Input Preprocessing
1. **Input Prompt:**
   - Example: _"The sun sets over the ocean"_
2. **Tokenization:**
   - The input is split into tokens using Hugging Face‚Äôs tokenizer:
     ```python
     from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer
     tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
     tokens = tokenizer.encode("The sun sets over the ocean", return_tensors="pt")
     ```
   - Tokenized Output: `[464, 795, 1524, 1426, 481, 262, 3035]`

3. **Padding (if needed):**
   - Ensures all inputs have the same length.

---

### Step 2: Feeding Input to the Model
- The tokenized input is passed to GPT-2 for generating predictions:
  ```python
  from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel
  model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
  output = model.generate(tokens, max_length=20, num_return_sequences=1)

- Example Output: "The sun sets over the ocean, painting the sky with golden hues."

Example Result:
Prompt: "Under the starlit sky, I wonder"
Generated Output: "What secrets the night will uncover, as the winds whisper softly by."
